amfontai Notes is a simple, straight-forward note-taking app.
Hit the pencil to add a note! Hit a note to edit a note!
Hit the cloud to get a word cloud of all the words in your note!
(word cloud. such web 2.0)

Saving? Who needs that! This baby'll do it automatically in less than 12
parsecs. I added a save button just for you folks you don't believe in
'automatic' (I'm one of you!). Look at that beautiful date picker! Such holo!
